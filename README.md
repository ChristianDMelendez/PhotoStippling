# 🖊️ Ultra Fine Stippling Art Generator

This project is a browser-based stippling art tool that transforms standard images into detailed, fine-dot illustrations — inspired by hand-drawn pen-and-ink styles.

Built for artists, creators, and anyone curious about digital stipple effects, this tool allows you to generate stunning colored stippling renderings entirely inside your browser.

## 🧠 How It Works (No Uploads Involved)

This tool is 100% client-side — it runs entirely in your browser.

When you upload an image:

- It stays local to your device only
- The stippled version is rendered on your screen and downloaded directly

> There is no server, no storage, and no tracking.  
> Just pure creative processing inside your browser.
